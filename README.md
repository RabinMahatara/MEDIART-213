# Lab10_Rabin - Web Project

This is a web-based project for **MEDIART 213**, containing HTML, CSS, images, and a video. The project is structured to ensure all files work seamlessly together when downloaded and opened locally.

## Project Structure

- **Root Folder (`Lab10_Rabin`)**:
  - Contains four HTML files:
    - `index.html`
    - `projects.html`
    - `contact.html`
    - `about.html`
  - Three subfolders:
    - **`css/` Folder**: Contains the main stylesheet (`style.css`).
    - **`img/` Folder**: Contains four images used in the project.
    - **`video/` Folder**: Contains one video used in the project.

## How to Use

1. Download from the repository link below:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/RabinMahatara/MEDIART-213.git
2. Navigate to the Lab10_Rabin folder.
3. Ensure the folder structure remains intact after downloading.
4. Open any of the HTML files (e.g., index.html) in a browser by double-clicking it or dragging it into the browser window.

   
## Important Notes

- Do not move or rename any folders or files, as this will break the file paths and cause the HTML files to stop working properly.
- If you encounter issues, ensure all files are downloaded and maintain their original structure.
